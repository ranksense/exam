title: Introducing RankSense for Cloudflare
---

RankSense is an [app that runs on Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/ranksense) to monitor SEO issues, implement fixes, and track performance. This combination of features will help you speed up implementation, validate that your changes were effective, and ultimately get results faster.

### Monitor SEO issues

RankSense monitors for SEO issues on important pages and optionally alerts you when new issues arise. This can help you catch SEO issues before they become a major problem.

### Implement fixes

RankSense is able to implement a variety of SEO changes without requiring developers. We use simple spreadsheets to import changes to meta tags and robots.txt. You can verify that your changes will be applied correctly by using our staging environment, then publish to production. 

### Track performance to validate effectiveness

RankSense can track the number of clicks coming to the site from organic search visitors. Our tagging system can be used to tag pages based on the issue they have, the solution that was applied, and/or the type of page. Then you can easily filter the performance report based on any of those tags.
