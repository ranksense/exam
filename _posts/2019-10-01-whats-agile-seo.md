title: What is agile search engine optimization?
---

An agile process breaks up a large project into smaller tasks and allows for feedback along the way. The course of the project can be adjusted based on the feedback received. In SEO, this means that we can implement fixes quickly, validate their effectiveness, and adjust course if needed.

Agile projects are worked on in “sprints,” typically 1 or 2 week periods. Although the agile method was designed for developers, we can apply it to SEO as well.

We recommend prioritizing the audit to initially focus on the areas that are high-impact and also quick to fix using the RankSense app. This helps to get some “quick wins” for the client. The lengthier parts of the SEO process can be worked on later.

This means your audit will initially focus on the types of issues that can be fixed by the app (see the list above). When an issue is discovered, a rules sheet can be quickly prepared and deployed, if the client approves. Some clients will wish to have approval over every change, whereas others will be content to let you manage the changes.

For the agile method, tracking SEO changes is critical because it will provide the feedback on whether the changes had an impact or not. The results are reviewed at regular intervals, and the SEO manager can make adjustments if needed.
